Determine which cities will be most and least expensive to stay in for 30-40 year olds. Uses the Seaborn library for visualization of data.

[Salary Prediction](https://github.com/arpita93/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Salary%20Prediction.ipynb)
Predict salary of employees using linear regression. Used selectKBest from scikit-learn to choose the best 3 features that contributes to the prediction. 

[Medical Text Classification](https://github.com/arpita93/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Medical%20Classification%20Linear%20SVM.ipynb)
Classify medical abstracts into 11 classes. Used TF-IDF to convert text into vectors. Used Linear SVM to maximize F1 score.

[Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/arpita93/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Recommendation%20Systems.ipynb)
Item based collaborative filtering. Cosine similarity was used to predict the rating. Then the top 3 similarities was picked to get a better recomendation.
